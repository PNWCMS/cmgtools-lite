The branch gjet_l1_trigerob_HLTbit in the output ntuple can be used to determin which HLT object has been matched with the photon. For example, "HLT_Photon50_R9Id90_HE10_IsoM" is the 3rd element defined in the list multtrg.HLTlist (in run_xzz2l2nu_80x_cfg_photon_dt.py), then by doing "gjet_l1_trigerob_HLTbit>>3&1", one can tell if HLT_Photon50_R9Id90_HE10_IsoM is matched with the photon (1 for yes 0 for no)
